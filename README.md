# BrainFuck part 4 - Advanced maths

The goal of this playground is to learn some mathematical algorithms implemented using BF

At then end of this playground, you should be able to 
* read a decimal integer from standard input
* perform euclidean division (quotient and remainder)
* print an integer in base 10
* read comma-separated decimal integers from standard input
* compare integers (LE / LT / GE / GT)
* compute integer part of square root
  * using Newton's method
  * using a naive but efficient approach

Have fun !
